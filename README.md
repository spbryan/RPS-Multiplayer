# RPS-Multiplayer

A multiplayer game of the wildly exciting classic "rock-paper-scissors"

This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game created to exercise new skills using firebase as part of work for a course.  It is intended for two players interacting
through separate browsers.

How does it work?
-  User selects either player 1 or player 2
-  User then selects a rock, paper, or scissors option
-  The value is stored in a firebase table until the other player has also made an entry
-  Once both entries are on the data base the system determines the winner or if it is a tie
-  A score for both players in managed in the firebase data base
-  The first player to reach best of 5 wins
-  Players may add commentary through an exposed text box.  This detail is captured and stored on the data base and displayed in a common chat history


What is the goal of this project? To exercise new skills in jQuery, javaScript, css, bootstrap, and html, and firebase
